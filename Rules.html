                <h2>Classic mode</h2>
                <p>Each player, on his turn, tries to find matching cards, by flipping two cards at a time. If the cards match, the player continues. Otherwise, the palyer will place the cards face down in the original position and give his turn to the next player. The player with most matching card pairs wins.</p>

                <h2>Challenge mode</h2>
                <p>In a timed memory game, players flip over pairs of cards to find matches while racing against the clock. Cards are arranged face down in a grid, and players aim to match pairs with the same symbol by remembering their locations. Set a time limit of your choice (be competitive) and score points for each successful match. The game ends when all pairs are matched or when time runs out. The challenge lies in matching as many pairs as possible within the time limit, testing players' memory and speed.</p>

            <div id="multiplayer" class="rules">
                <h2>Multiplayer mode</h2>
                <p>The game starts with all the cards face down and players take turns to turn over two cards. If the two cards have the same picture, then they keep the cards, otherwise they turn the cards face down again. Each player has only one chance each round. The winner is the person with the most cards when all the cards have been taken.</p>
